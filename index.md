## ⭐ Featured Project: Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI)

**Research replication & adaptation for real-world, low-cost robotics**

- Adapted the *Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI)* research system from its original  
  **UR5 + GoPro Hero 9 + industrial gripper** configuration to a **home-built robotic platform**.
- Deployed on an **AR4 robotic arm**, **custom 3D-printed servo gripper**, and a **consumer-grade fisheye camera**.
- Modified perception and manipulation pipelines to handle:
  - Wide-FOV monocular imagery
  - Noisy, uncalibrated consumer sensors
  - Mechanical and control constraints of hobby-grade hardware
- Focused on reproducibility, robustness, and practical embodiment of manipulation research.
