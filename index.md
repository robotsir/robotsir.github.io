## ⭐ Featured Project: Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI)

**Adaptation for DIY low-cost robotics**

- Adapted the *Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI)* framework from its original  
  **UR5 + GoPro + industrial gripper** configuration to a **home-built robotic platform**.
- Deployed on an **AR4 robotic arm**, **custom 3D-printed servo gripper**, and a **consumer-grade fisheye camera**.
- Modified perception and manipulation pipelines to handle:
  - Mechanical and control constraints of hobby-grade robot arm
  - Low speed, high latency servo gripper
  - Low FPS USB camera
